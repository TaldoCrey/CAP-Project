# CAP-Project

This is a repository of CAP's Project made by Renan Machado Santos, Gabriel Kazushige Vieira Kosaihira, Bruno Kenzo Saito e Rodrigo Bernardo Barbosa.

## What we learn at CAP classes?

CAP is an acronym for "Construção de Algoritmos e Programação", and is the first coding subject we have at UFSCAR's Computer Science course. We learn how to program starting from scratch, learning first the logic behind the lines of code and only after learning it we start coding our first programs.

## What is this project?

The idea of this project, that was assigned by our professor Jander Moreira, is that we should gather all of the knoledge acquired during the classes and show it in one program. This said, let's talk a little about our project for Jander's task.

# Our Project

Jander told us the project doesn't need to be too much complex, but it should not be a simple program as a "Hello, World!". So our group had the idea to make a backend system to a grocery store. The system must keep track of how many products the store has in its product stock and the price of it individual product (which may be changed during execution). Also, it was thought to run in two different type of computers: the cashier computers and the management computers. So, while keeping track of product quantity and prices are features intended for the management computers, receiving products codes, associate them with its respective product price and calculating the money transaction of clients are features intended for the cashier computers. 

So, in a nutshell, our group is going to make a functional grocery's store backend system for the cashier and for the management team.
